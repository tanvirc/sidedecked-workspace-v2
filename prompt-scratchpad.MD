## PROMPT SCRATCHPAD

Install BMAD https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD and upgrade this workspace to implement the full planning path. Define any Agents that this project should use and update CLAUDE.md file and any other docs

Research best practices for Agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc) and create a new instruction file for each repo (and root) that is fully optimized for Claude Code and incorporates all necessary context, critical rules, best practices, and follows Karpathy approach as per the git repo https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills. Remove any superfluous information in other markdown files and remove any markdown files that are no longer required provided the information is captured elsewhere


i want to ensure that the SM works with the PM to prioritise and assign the right next story. then the BA works with the PM and UX Designer to define and clarrify requirements and UX. Then the Architect designs the technical
   solution. Then the Dev builds code and unit tests. Then the QA testers runs tests. Then the Techn Writer updates any documents. How would i orchestrate this workflow?
