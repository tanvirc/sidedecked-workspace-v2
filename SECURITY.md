## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in SideDecked, please follow our responsible disclosure process.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
=ç **security@sidedecked.com**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: The potential impact and affected components
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Platform, browser, version details
5. **Proof of Concept**: Screenshots, logs, or minimal code examples
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge your email within **48 hours** and provide a more detailed response within **7 days** indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, we will:
- Keep you informed of progress toward a fix
- May request additional information or guidance
- Credit you appropriately when we disclose the vulnerability

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth2 Implementation**: PKCE-enabled OAuth2 flows
- **JWT Security**: Secure token handling with proper expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions system
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and token refresh

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database and file storage encryption
- **PCI Compliance**: Secure payment processing (no card storage)
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary user data

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates and patches
- **Network Security**: Properly configured firewalls and access controls
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

### Development Security

- **Secure Coding**: Security-focused code review process
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and security audits

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update npm packages
2. **Follow Secure Coding**: Use our security guidelines
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets or credentials

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, strong passwords
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
3. **Keep Updated**: Use the latest version of the application
4. **Report Issues**: Report suspicious activity immediately
5. **Safe Browsing**: Be cautious of phishing attempts

## Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Integrations

- **Payment Processing**: Handled via Stripe (PCI compliant)
- **OAuth Providers**: Google, GitHub integrations
- **External APIs**: TCG data sources (Scryfall, Pokémon TCG API)
- **CDN Services**: Image delivery and static assets

### Data Handling

- **Personal Information**: Minimal collection, secure storage
- **Financial Data**: No credit card storage, tokenized payments
- **User Content**: Public content moderation, privacy controls
- **API Keys**: Secure generation and rotation

## Vulnerability Management

### Process

1. **Detection**: Automated scanning and manual reviews
2. **Assessment**: Risk evaluation and impact analysis
3. **Remediation**: Patch development and testing
4. **Deployment**: Coordinated security updates
5. **Communication**: Advisory publication and user notification

### Emergency Response

For critical vulnerabilities:
- **Immediate Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Emergency Patches**: Within 72 hours
- **User Notification**: Via email and security advisories
- **Documentation**: Post-mortem and lessons learned

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published at:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Project documentation
- Email notifications to users
- Security mailing list (coming soon)

## Compliance

### Standards

- **OWASP**: Following OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management practices
- **GDPR**: European data protection compliance
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act compliance

### Regular Assessments
