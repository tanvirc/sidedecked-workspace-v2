# 🎯 Enhanced Definition of Done Checklist

**Critical validation:** Story is truly ready for review only when ALL items below are satisfied

## 📋 Context & Requirements Validation

- [ ] **Story Context Completeness:** Dev Notes contains ALL necessary technical requirements, architecture patterns, and implementation guidance
- [ ] **Architecture Compliance:** Implementation follows all architectural requirements specified in Dev Notes
- [ ] **Technical Specifications:** All technical specifications (libraries, frameworks, versions) from Dev Notes are implemented correctly
- [ ] **Previous Story Learnings:** Previous story insights incorporated (if applicable) and build upon appropriately

## ✅ Implementation Completion

- [ ] **All Tasks Complete:** Every task and subtask marked complete with [x]
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction:** Implementation satisfies EVERY Acceptance Criterion in the story
- [ ] **No Ambiguous Implementation:** Clear, unambiguous implementation that meets story requirements
- [ ] **Edge Cases Handled:** Error conditions and edge cases appropriately addressed
- [ ] **Dependencies Within Scope:** Only uses dependencies specified in story or project-context.md

## 🎨 UX Wireframe Compliance (when applicable)

- [ ] **Wireframe Token Mapping Table Created:** Before coding, every wireframe CSS value mapped to its Tailwind equivalent; missing imports/variables flagged
- [ ] **Design Tokens Used:** All colors, spacing, borders use project design tokens (CSS variables), NOT hardcoded Tailwind color classes
- [ ] **Layout Matches Wireframe:** Component hierarchy, grid structure, and responsive breakpoints match the wireframe HTML
- [ ] **Full-Page Context Verified:** Full page layout matches wireframe — not just the component in isolation; render order, spacing, and container nesting checked
- [ ] **Interaction States Match:** Hover, focus, active, loading, empty, and error states match wireframe specifications
- [ ] **Mobile Patterns Match:** Mobile-specific patterns (bottom sheets, touch targets, responsive columns) match wireframe
- [ ] **Font Import Chain Verified:** Every wireframe-specified typeface is imported (layout.tsx), has CSS variable (colors.css), and has Tailwind utility (tailwind.config)
- [ ] **Exact Values Used:** Wireframe exact CSS values use Tailwind arbitrary values (border-[1.5px], shadow-[...]) — not approximate standard utilities
- [ ] **No Anti-Patterns:** No alert(), no hover-gated functionality, no hardcoded colors bypassing design system
- [ ] **Phase 5B Readiness:** Key UI elements have `data-testid` attributes (containers, interactive controls, state indicators) for Playwright UX assertions

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Unit tests added/updated for ALL core functionality introduced/changed by this story
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Integration tests added/updated for component interactions when story requirements demand them
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** For any story touching UI/UX: Playwright tests created in `storefront/e2e/` covering the story's critical user flows. Run `npm run test:e2e` and confirm all pass.
- [ ] **Test Coverage:** Tests cover acceptance criteria and edge cases from story Dev Notes
- [ ] **Regression Prevention:** ALL existing tests pass (no regressions introduced)
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Linting and static checks pass when configured in project
- [ ] **Test Framework Compliance:** Tests use project's testing frameworks and patterns from Dev Notes

## 📝 Documentation & Tracking

- [ ] **File List Complete:** File List includes EVERY new, modified, or deleted file (paths relative to repo root)
- [ ] **Dev Agent Record Updated:** Contains relevant Implementation Notes and/or Debug Log for this work
- [ ] **Change Log Updated:** Change Log includes clear summary of what changed and why
- [ ] **Review Follow-ups:** All review follow-up tasks (marked [AI-Review]) completed and corresponding review items marked resolved (if applicable)
- [ ] **Story Structure Compliance:** Only permitted sections of story file were modified

## 🔚 Final Status Verification

- [ ] **Story Status Updated:** Story Status set to "review"
- [ ] **Sprint Status Updated:** Sprint status updated to "review" (when sprint tracking is used)
- [ ] **Quality Gates Passed:** All quality checks and validations completed successfully
- [ ] **No HALT Conditions:** No blocking issues or incomplete work remaining
- [ ] **User Communication Ready:** Implementation summary prepared for user review

## 🎯 Final Validation Output

```
Definition of Done: {{PASS/FAIL}}

✅ **Story Ready for Review:** {{story_key}}
📊 **Completion Score:** {{completed_items}}/{{total_items}} items passed
🔍 **Quality Gates:** {{quality_gates_status}}
📋 **Test Results:** {{test_results_summary}}
