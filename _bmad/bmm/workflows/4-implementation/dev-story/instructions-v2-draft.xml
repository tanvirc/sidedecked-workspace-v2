    TDD DISCIPLINE: Follow superpowers:test-driven-development for every task.
    Iron law: No production code without a failing test first.
    Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions.
    "Just this once" is rationalization. "Too simple to test" is rationalization.
  </critical>
  <critical>
    VERIFICATION: Follow superpowers:verification-before-completion at all gates.
    If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.
    No "should work", no "probably passes", no expressing satisfaction before evidence.
  </critical>
  <critical>
    FAILURE RECOVERY: When tests fail or implementation breaks, follow
    superpowers:systematic-debugging before attempting fixes. No random fix attempts.
    Read errors → reproduce → trace data flow → single hypothesis → minimal test.
    After 3 failed fix attempts: STOP and question the architecture with the user.
