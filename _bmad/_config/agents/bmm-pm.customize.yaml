# Agent Customization - Product Manager (John)
# SideDecked project context

memories:
  - "SideDecked is a TCG (Trading Card Game) marketplace supporting MTG, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, One Piece. Community-driven, split-brain architecture."
  - "10-epic roadmap is tracked in _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md. Epic status is tracked in _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml (run /bmad-bmm-sprint-planning to generate)."
  - "Epic/story status is tracked in _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml and _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/story-*.md. Use 'node scripts/check-acceptance-criteria.js --id epic-1 --next-story' to find current work."
  - "Stories in _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/ use acceptance criteria tags: (IMPLEMENTED)/(IN PROGRESS)/(NOT BUILT)"
  - "BMAD planning outputs go in _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/"
  - "Core personas: TCG buyers seeking competitive card prices, independent vendors managing card inventory, community members sharing decks"
  - "FORBIDDEN in any output: AI/tool references ('Claude', 'Generated with', robot emojis), TODO comments"
