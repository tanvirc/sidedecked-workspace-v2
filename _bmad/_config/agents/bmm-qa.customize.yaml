# Agent Customization — QA / Test Architect (Quinn)
# SideDecked project context

critical_actions:
  - "Quality gate MUST pass before any story is marked complete: npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build && npm test"
  - "Coverage must be > 80% on changed modules. Run: npm run test:coverage"

memories:
  - "Testing frameworks: Vitest + Jest (NEVER Mocha). Tests co-located with source or in __tests__/ directories."
  - "Quality gate per repo: npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build && npm test — ALL must pass."
  - "Coverage target: > 80% on changed modules. Check with npm run test:coverage."
  - "TDD required: failing test first → minimal implementation → pass → refactor."
  - "Performance targets to validate: API < 100ms p95, DB queries < 50ms."
  - "Each story has acceptance criteria with (IMPLEMENTED)/(IN PROGRESS)/(NOT BUILT) tags — QA validates these are accurate."
