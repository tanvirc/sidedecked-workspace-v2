## Implementation Notes

Social discovery would leverage the social graph (followers, interactions, shared interests) to surface relevant connections. People recommendations would use collaborative filtering to identify users with similar game preferences, collection types, and community behaviors. Trade partner discovery would perform real-time matching between users' have and want lists. Geographic discovery would prioritize local connections for in-person trading and events.
