# Story 6.2.2: Group Messaging & Communities

**Epic**: [epic-06-community-social.md](../epics/epic-06-community-social.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a user, I want to create and join group chats so that I can coordinate with multiple players simultaneously for team events, trades, and community discussions._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Group chat creation with custom names, descriptions, and avatars
- (NOT BUILT) Invite system for adding members to groups with permission controls
- (NOT BUILT) Role-based permissions within groups (admin, moderator, member)
- (NOT BUILT) Group message threading for organized multi-topic discussions
- (NOT BUILT) Pinned messages for important group announcements
- (NOT BUILT) Group event coordination with integrated scheduling
- (NOT BUILT) Community channels for topic-specific discussions within groups
- (NOT BUILT) Group file and resource sharing library
- (NOT BUILT) Group analytics for moderators showing engagement metrics
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with trading and deck sharing features within groups

## Implementation Notes

Group messaging extends the direct messaging infrastructure to support multiple participants. Groups would support up to specified member limits with role-based administration. Community channels within groups would organize discussions by topic (e.g., #deck-help, #trades, #announcements). Pinned messages would surface important information at the top of channels. Group event coordination would integrate with the local events system.
