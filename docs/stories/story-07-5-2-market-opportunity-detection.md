**Epic**: [epic-07-pricing-intelligence.md](../epics/epic-07-pricing-intelligence.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As an opportunistic buyer, I want automatic opportunity detection so that I can find good deals and arbitrage opportunities across the market._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Automatic identification of listings priced below market value
- (NOT BUILT) Cross-marketplace arbitrage detection with profit calculation
- (NOT BUILT) Bulk purchase opportunity identification for set completion
- (NOT BUILT) Time-sensitive opportunity alerts for auction ending soon
- (NOT BUILT) Seller distress signals indicating motivated sellers
- (NOT BUILT) Opportunity scoring based on discount depth and liquidity
- (NOT BUILT) Risk assessment for each opportunity with relevant factors
- (NOT BUILT) Opportunity tracking with outcome recording for strategy improvement
- (NOT BUILT) Budget-filtered opportunities matching user spending capacity
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with shopping cart for immediate opportunity action

## Implementation Notes

Opportunity detection would continuously monitor new listings and price changes across the SideDecked marketplace and integrated external markets. Underpriced listing detection would compare each listing against the condition-adjusted market average. Arbitrage opportunities would identify cards available below resale value with sufficient margin to cover fees and shipping. Time-sensitive alerts for auctions ending soon would integrate with real-time monitoring of external platforms.
