**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a player, I want to discover and organize local TCG events so that I can find games and tournaments near me._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Event listing with location, date, format, and prize information
- (NOT BUILT) Map-based event discovery with radius filtering
- (NOT BUILT) Event creation tools for store owners and community organizers
- (NOT BUILT) Event registration and attendance tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Format-specific event categories (competitive, casual, draft, sealed)
- (NOT BUILT) Event reminders and calendar integration
- (NOT BUILT) Event results reporting and standings tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Store and venue profiles with event history
- (NOT BUILT) Virtual event support for online tournaments
- (NOT BUILT) Event discovery recommendations based on user location and game preferences

## Implementation Notes

Event discovery would use a map interface for geographic browsing alongside a list view with filtering by game, format, distance, and date. Event organizers (local game stores and community leaders) would create events with full details. Registration would support capacity limits and waitlists. Results reporting would feed into player ranking systems and community reputation. Integration with calendar apps (Google, Apple, Outlook) would send reminders.
