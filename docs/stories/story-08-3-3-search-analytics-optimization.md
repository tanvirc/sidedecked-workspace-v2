# Story 8.3.3: Advanced Search Analytics & Optimization

**Epic**: [epic-08-search-discovery.md](../epics/epic-08-search-discovery.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Both

## User Story

_As a platform operator, I want sophisticated search analytics so that I can optimize search performance and understand user needs._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Search query analytics with volume, click-through, and conversion tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Zero-result query tracking to identify catalog gaps
- (NOT BUILT) Search abandonment analysis for user experience improvement
- (NOT BUILT) A/B testing framework for search ranking algorithm changes
- (NOT BUILT) Query reformulation tracking showing how users refine failed searches
- (NOT BUILT) Search performance metrics dashboard for operations team
- (NOT BUILT) Automated search quality scoring with regression detection
- (NOT BUILT) Search satisfaction surveys with result quality feedback
- (NOT BUILT) Trending query detection for proactive content and catalog updates
- (NOT BUILT) Search index health monitoring with data freshness tracking

## Implementation Notes

Search analytics would capture every query, result set, and user interaction to build a comprehensive view of search behavior. Zero-result tracking would feed directly into catalog management to identify missing cards or content. The A/B testing framework would allow controlled experiments with different ranking algorithms. Automated quality scoring would detect regressions after algorithm or data changes before they impact users.
