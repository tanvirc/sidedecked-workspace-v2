**Epic**: [epic-02-commerce-marketplace.md](../epics/epic-02-commerce-marketplace.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Commerce (backend/)

## User Story

_As a customer or vendor, I want access to fair dispute resolution so that transaction issues can be resolved equitably._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Dispute initiation from order details page
- (NOT BUILT) Evidence submission (photos, messages, documentation)
- (NOT BUILT) Platform mediation with neutral case managers
- (NOT BUILT) Time-limited response windows for all parties
- (NOT BUILT) Escalation process for unresolved disputes
- (NOT BUILT) Final decision communication with detailed reasoning
- (NOT BUILT) Refund/compensation processing based on decisions
- (NOT BUILT) Dispute history tracking and pattern analysis
- (NOT BUILT) Appeal process for disputed decisions
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with payment processor dispute systems

## Implementation Notes

The dispute system would use pages at `/disputes/create` and `/disputes/:id`. The evidence submission portal would support multi-file uploads (photos, receipts, messages) with categorization and timeline organization. A secure messaging panel would connect customers, vendors, and platform mediators. Settlement offer negotiation and appeal workflows would be supported.
