**Epic**: [epic-05-deck-building.md](../epics/epic-05-deck-building.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a deck builder, I want to easily purchase missing cards so that I can complete my deck builds._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) One-click shopping cart addition for missing cards from deck
- (NOT BUILT) Price comparison across multiple vendors for best deals
- (NOT BUILT) Bundle optimization suggesting combined purchases for shipping savings
- (NOT BUILT) Condition preference settings for purchasing cards
- (NOT BUILT) Shopping list generation with priorities and budget constraints
- (NOT BUILT) Vendor reputation integration for trusted seller selection
- (NOT BUILT) Saved payment methods and shipping addresses for quick checkout
- (NOT BUILT) Order tracking integration showing progress on deck completion
- (NOT BUILT) Budget tracking and spending alerts for deck building projects
- (NOT BUILT) Group purchase coordination for expensive cards with other users

## Implementation Notes

The shopping integration panel within the deck builder would display a "Missing Cards" list with total cost and one-click "Add All to Cart". The BundleOptimizer would combine orders from the same vendor to minimize shipping costs. Condition preferences (NM, LP, MP, HP) would affect price filters. The BudgetTracker would set spending limits and show alerts when approaching thresholds. Integration with the marketplace would show live vendor availability and pricing.
