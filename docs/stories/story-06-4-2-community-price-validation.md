**Epic**: [epic-06-community-social.md](../epics/epic-06-community-social.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a community member, I want crowd-sourced price validation so that I can verify fair market values and identify pricing anomalies._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Community price reporting for marketplace listings above/below market value
- (NOT BUILT) Crowdsourced price confirmation with weighted community votes
- (NOT BUILT) Price dispute resolution for flagged outlier listings
- (NOT BUILT) Community price contributor reputation and accuracy tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with automated pricing intelligence for hybrid validation
- (NOT BUILT) Price alert system for community-reported significant changes
- (NOT BUILT) Historical community price data with trend visualization
- (NOT BUILT) Local market price adjustments reported by regional communities
- (NOT BUILT) Price manipulation detection with community flag thresholds
- (NOT BUILT) Educational content on card valuation methodology

## Implementation Notes

Community price validation would augment the automated pricing intelligence system with human verification. Community members could flag listings as overpriced or underpriced, triggering review workflows. Weighted voting would give more weight to users with strong price validation track records. Local market price reporting would account for regional pricing variations not captured by major marketplace aggregators.
