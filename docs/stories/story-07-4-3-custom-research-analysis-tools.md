## User Story

_As an advanced user, I want custom research tools so that I can conduct my own market analysis and develop investment strategies._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Custom chart builder with configurable metrics, time ranges, and card comparisons
- (NOT BUILT) Custom screening tools to filter cards by multiple investment criteria
- (NOT BUILT) Saved screen library with scheduling and alert integration
- (NOT BUILT) Custom index creation for tracking specific card baskets
- (NOT BUILT) Backtesting framework for testing investment strategies on historical data
- (NOT BUILT) API access for power users to pull data into external tools
- (NOT BUILT) Collaborative research spaces for sharing analyses with trusted users
- (NOT BUILT) Custom report generation with branded templates
- (NOT BUILT) Statistical analysis tools (regression, correlation, Monte Carlo simulation)
- (NOT BUILT) Export in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) for external analysis

## Implementation Notes

Custom research tools would provide programmatic access to the underlying market data for sophisticated users. The custom chart builder would support overlaying multiple cards, indices, and market benchmarks on the same visualization. The screening tool would allow filtering by any combination of price, volume, volatility, format legality, rarity, and set attributes. Backtesting would simulate historical strategy performance with transaction cost modeling.
