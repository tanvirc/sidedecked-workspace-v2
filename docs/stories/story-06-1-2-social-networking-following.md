**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a user, I want to follow other TCG players and collectors so that I can stay connected with their activities and discoveries._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (IN PROGRESS) Follow/unfollow functionality with immediate updates and notifications (PARTIAL)
- (NOT BUILT) Follower and following lists with profile previews and quick actions
- (NOT BUILT) Activity feed showing followed users' decks, trades, forum posts, and achievements
- (NOT BUILT) Follow recommendations based on similar interests, gaming preferences, and mutual connections
- (NOT BUILT) Privacy settings for follower requests and activity visibility
- (NOT BUILT) Social discovery through mutual connections and shared interests
- (NOT BUILT) Follow notifications with customizable frequency and types
- (NOT BUILT) Block and mute functionality for managing unwanted interactions
- (NOT BUILT) Social graph analysis showing connection strength and interaction history
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with deck sharing and trading systems for social context

## Implementation Notes

Basic follow/unfollow functionality exists in the platform. The full social network experience requires an activity feed aggregating followed users' actions across deck building, trading, and forum participation. Follow recommendations would use collaborative filtering based on gaming preferences, mutual connections, and interaction patterns. Social graph analysis would power content personalization and discovery features.
