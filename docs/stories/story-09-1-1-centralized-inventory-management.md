## Implementation Notes

The centralized inventory system provides a unified view across all sales channels with real-time synchronization. Multi-location tracking supports warehouse and physical store separation. Channel-specific allocation prevents overselling when the same stock is listed across multiple platforms. Bulk import/export supports CSV and API integration. Cost basis tracking exists partially with FIFO implementation in progress.
