**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a community member, I want rich posting tools so that I can create engaging, well-formatted discussion posts._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (IN PROGRESS) Rich text editor with formatting options, images, videos, and card embeds (PARTIAL)
- (NOT BUILT) Advanced search functionality across all posts with filters and sorting options
- (NOT BUILT) Post templates for common discussion types (deck help, trade posts, tournament reports)
- (NOT BUILT) Voting system for posts and comments with reputation impact
- (NOT BUILT) Best answer marking for help requests and question posts
- (NOT BUILT) Post bookmarking and personal organization features
- (NOT BUILT) Share functionality for social media and direct messaging integration
- (NOT BUILT) Post analytics for authors including view counts, engagement rates, and feedback
- (NOT BUILT) Real-time collaborative editing for community-driven content creation
- (NOT BUILT) Post scheduling and draft saving for content planning

## Implementation Notes

A rich text editor exists partially in the platform. Full forum posting would add card embed support for displaying card previews inline, image and video embedding, and post templates for structured discussion types like deck help requests and tournament reports. The voting system would impact community reputation scores. Best answer marking would improve discoverability of solved questions.
