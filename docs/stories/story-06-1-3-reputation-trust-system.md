# Story 6.1.3: Reputation & Trust System

**Epic**: [epic-06-community-social.md](../epics/epic-06-community-social.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a community member, I want a transparent reputation system so that I can establish trust and evaluate the reliability of other users._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Community reputation score based on trading history, forum contributions, and deck sharing
- (NOT BUILT) Verified trader badge system for users with strong transaction history
- (NOT BUILT) Reputation breakdown showing individual component scores
- (NOT BUILT) Community-driven reputation through peer endorsements and reviews
- (NOT BUILT) Reputation impact on platform privileges and visibility
- (NOT BUILT) Reputation recovery process for users with resolved issues
- (NOT BUILT) Anti-gaming measures to prevent reputation manipulation
- (NOT BUILT) Reputation integration across trading, selling, and community features

## Implementation Notes

The community reputation system differs from the seller trust score in Epic 2. It encompasses broader community participation including forum quality, deck building contributions, trade reliability, and peer endorsements. Reputation scores would influence content visibility, trading limits, and community moderator eligibility. Anti-gaming measures would detect coordinated reputation manipulation attempts.
