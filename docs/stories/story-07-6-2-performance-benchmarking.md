## User Story

_As an investor, I want performance benchmarking so that I can compare my portfolio performance against market indices and peer groups._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Platform-wide market indices for each supported TCG game
- (NOT BUILT) Sub-indices by rarity tier, set age, and card type
- (NOT BUILT) Portfolio comparison against relevant benchmark indices
- (NOT BUILT) Peer group benchmarking with anonymized similar portfolio comparisons
- (NOT BUILT) Alpha calculation showing outperformance vs. passive index strategies
- (NOT BUILT) Benchmark customization for user-defined comparison portfolios
- (NOT BUILT) Historical benchmark data with long-term performance tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Benchmark alerts when portfolio diverges significantly from index
- (NOT BUILT) Attribution analysis showing benchmark outperformance/underperformance sources
- (NOT BUILT) Benchmark export for external reporting and analysis

## Implementation Notes

Platform-wide indices would track the aggregate performance of cards by game, set, and rarity tier. The MTG index would cover all Standard-legal cards with sub-indices for each rarity. Peer group benchmarking would match users with similar portfolio sizes and game focuses for anonymized comparison. Alpha calculation would subtract the benchmark return from portfolio return, adjusted for risk using volatility normalization.
