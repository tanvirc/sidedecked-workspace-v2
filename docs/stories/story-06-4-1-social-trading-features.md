## User Story

_As a collector, I want social trading features so that I can find fair trades and connect with other collectors who have cards I need._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Tradeable collection listing with wanted and have-for-trade sections
- (NOT BUILT) Trade matching system connecting users with complementary needs
- (NOT BUILT) Public trade offer boards for broadcasting trade requests
- (NOT BUILT) Trade value comparison tools using current market pricing

## Implementation Notes

Social trading would complement the marketplace by enabling card-for-card exchanges without monetary transactions. The have/want list system would be part of each user's public profile. The trade matching engine would analyze users' have and want lists to identify mutual trade opportunities. Value comparison tools would use real-time market data to help both parties agree on fair trades. Trade reputation would be separate from but linked to marketplace seller reputation.
