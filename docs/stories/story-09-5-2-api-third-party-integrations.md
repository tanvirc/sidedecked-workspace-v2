# Story 9.5.2: API & Third-Party Integrations

**Epic**: [epic-09-inventory-management.md](../epics/epic-09-inventory-management.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Both

## User Story

_As a tech-savvy vendor, I want comprehensive API access so that I can integrate inventory management with my existing tools and workflows._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints for all inventory management functions
- (NOT BUILT) Webhook support for real-time inventory updates and event notifications
- (NOT BUILT) SDK availability for popular programming languages and development platforms
- (NOT BUILT) Rate limiting and authentication for secure and scalable API access
- (NOT BUILT) Bulk operation support for efficient large-scale data synchronization
- (NOT BUILT) Custom field support for vendor-specific data requirements and workflows
- (NOT BUILT) Integration marketplace with pre-built connectors for popular tools and services
- (NOT BUILT) API documentation with examples, testing tools, and developer support
- (NOT BUILT) Sandbox environment for development and testing without affecting live inventory
- (NOT BUILT) Monitoring and analytics for API usage with performance optimization recommendations

## Implementation Notes

The public inventory API exposes all management functions via RESTful endpoints with webhook support for real-time updates. SDK availability in popular languages, rate limiting, and a sandbox environment are required for developer adoption. An integration marketplace with pre-built connectors accelerates third-party tool adoption.
