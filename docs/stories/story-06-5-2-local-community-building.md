## Implementation Notes

Local communities would be auto-generated based on geographic clustering of users and enriched by local game store affiliations. Community leaders would earn their role through active participation and community nomination. Local meta tracking would aggregate tournament results and deck usage from events within a region. The mentorship program would match new players with experienced community members based on game preferences and availability.
