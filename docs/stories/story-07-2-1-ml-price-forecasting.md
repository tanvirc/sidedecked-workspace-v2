**Epic**: [epic-07-pricing-intelligence.md](../epics/epic-07-pricing-intelligence.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a collector and investor, I want price predictions so that I can anticipate market movements and plan my collecting strategy._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Price forecasting models using historical data and market signals for each supported TCG game
- (NOT BUILT) Confidence interval display showing prediction certainty ranges
- (NOT BUILT) Model performance metrics and accuracy tracking over time
- (NOT BUILT) Feature importance visualization showing what drives price predictions
- (NOT BUILT) Short-term (1 week), medium-term (1 month), and long-term (6 month) forecasts
- (NOT BUILT) Set release impact predictions for affected card prices
- (NOT BUILT) Format rotation price impact modeling
- (NOT BUILT) Tournament result integration affecting demand predictions
- (NOT BUILT) Model retraining pipeline with fresh market data
- (NOT BUILT) Backtesting framework for validating prediction accuracy

## Implementation Notes

Price forecasting would use time-series modeling incorporating historical prices, trading volume, tournament schedules, set release calendars, and format rotation data. Confidence intervals would communicate prediction uncertainty. Backtesting would validate model performance against historical market movements. The retraining pipeline would continuously incorporate new market data to maintain prediction accuracy.
