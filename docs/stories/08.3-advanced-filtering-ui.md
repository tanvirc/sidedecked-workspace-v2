# Story 8.3: Advanced Filtering UI

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** collector,
**I want** advanced filters,
**so that** I can narrow search results precisely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AC1: Faceted UI offers multi-select controls, range sliders, and token inputs.
2. AC2: Filters persist in URL/query params for shareability.
3. AC3: Filter combinations update results without full page reload (virtualized infinite scroll).
4. AC4: Accessibility compliance verified (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement faceted filter components (multi-select, range slider, token input) tied to search context (AC1).
- [ ] Sync filter state with URL/query params and restore on load/share (AC2).
- [ ] Integrate filters with search results component supporting virtualization and dynamic updates (AC3).
- [ ] Conduct accessibility pass adding keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes (AC4).
- [ ] Add filter reset/preset capabilities and analytics tracking (AC1-AC3).
- [ ] Update documentation/guides for advanced filtering usage (AC1-AC4).

## Dev Notes
- Components located in `storefront/src/components/search/filters`; ensure modular for reuse.
- Use SWR or React Query to refetch results on filter changes without full reload.
- Combine with infinite scroll virtualization (e.g., `react-window`) for performance.
- Use `next/navigation` to manage URL updates without losing server component state.
- Accessibility review should include screen reader testing and focus management.

## Testing
- Component/unit tests for each filter control and serialization logic.
- Integration tests verifying URL persistence and state restoration.
- Playwright scenario: apply multiple filters, share URL, confirm results replicate.
- Accessibility automated checks (axe-core) plus manual keyboard walkthrough.
