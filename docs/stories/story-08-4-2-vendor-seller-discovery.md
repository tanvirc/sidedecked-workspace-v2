## User Story

_As a buyer, I want to discover reliable vendors and sellers so that I can find trusted sources for my purchases._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Vendor search with filtering by rating, location, game specialization, and inventory size
- (NOT BUILT) Vendor profile discovery pages with full listing catalogs
- (NOT BUILT) "Top vendors" featured sections by game and category
- (NOT BUILT) Vendor comparison tools for evaluating multiple sellers
- (NOT BUILT) Follow vendors for inventory update notifications
- (NOT BUILT) Vendor specialization badges (MTG specialist, Pokemon expert, etc.)

- (NOT BUILT) New vendor spotlight for recently joined quality sellers

- (NOT BUILT) Vendor reputation trend tracking showing improvement or decline over time

## Implementation Notes

Vendor discovery would provide dedicated browse and search capabilities for finding trusted sellers. Filtering by game specialization, ratings, ship-from location, and inventory breadth would help buyers find vendors matching their needs. Follow functionality would notify buyers when followed vendors list new inventory. Vendor profile pages would aggregate all listings, reviews, and reputation metrics in a single discoverable view.
