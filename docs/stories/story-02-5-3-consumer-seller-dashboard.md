## Implementation Notes

The individual seller dashboard would be located at `/sell/dashboard`. It would be a simplified version of the full vendor dashboard, focused on the needs of casual sellers. The tabbed interface would cover Overview, Listings, Sales, and Profile sections. Trust tier badges (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond) would visually represent seller reputation progression.
