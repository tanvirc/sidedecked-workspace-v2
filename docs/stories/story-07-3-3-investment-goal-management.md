## Implementation Notes

Goal management would support multiple goal types: completing a specific set, reaching a total collection value target, acquiring specific cards, or achieving a return on investment. Progress tracking would update in real-time as collection values change. Timeline estimation would incorporate market trends and historical price velocity for targeted cards. Smart goal suggestions would identify high-value opportunities based on the user's current collection and market data.
