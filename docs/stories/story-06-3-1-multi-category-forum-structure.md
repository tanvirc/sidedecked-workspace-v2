**Epic**: [epic-06-community-social.md](../epics/epic-06-community-social.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a community member, I want organized forums by game and topic so that I can find relevant discussions efficiently._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Hierarchical forum structure organized by game, topic, and format
- (NOT BUILT) Dedicated sections for each supported TCG game (MTG, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, One Piece)
- (NOT BUILT) Cross-game sections for marketplace, trading, and general discussion
- (NOT BUILT) Subforum creation for specific topics within each game
- (NOT BUILT) Forum navigation with breadcrumb trails and quick jump menus
- (NOT BUILT) Thread listing with sorting by date, popularity, and activity
- (NOT BUILT) Pinned and featured thread system for important announcements
- (NOT BUILT) Forum search with category filtering and date range options
- (NOT BUILT) Forum statistics showing post counts, active users, and trending topics
- (NOT BUILT) Mobile-optimized forum browsing with lazy loading

## Implementation Notes

The forum structure would use a hierarchical organization: Game → Category → Thread → Reply. Game-specific sections would cover deck discussion, strategy, trading, and rules questions. Cross-game sections would include marketplace announcements, price discussion, and community events. Moderators would manage pinned threads and featured content. Forum statistics would track engagement metrics for each subforum.
