## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Deck discovery feed with trending, popular, and recommended decks
- (NOT BUILT) User following system for favorite deck builders and content creators
- (NOT BUILT) Deck rating and review system with detailed feedback categories
- (NOT BUILT) Deck remix functionality allowing users to create variations of popular decks

## Implementation Notes

The community deck discovery would be surfaced at `/decks/public` and within each game's browsing area. A personalized feed would blend trending, popular, and algorithm-recommended decks based on the user's game preferences and follow list. The remix feature would clone a public deck into the user's library for modification. Meta tracking would integrate with tournament result data sources.
