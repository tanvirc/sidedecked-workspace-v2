# Story 04.1: Vendor Onboarding & Compliance

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** prospective vendor,
**I want** to complete compliance onboarding,
**so that** I can sell on SideDecked with required approvals.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AC1: Onboarding wizard captures business docs, payout details, tax info, and storefront preferences.
2. AC2: Admin approval workflow tracks status and notifications.
3. AC3: Stripe Connect account linkage required before activation.
4. AC4: Audit logs and KYC status stored for regulatory checks.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement multi-step onboarding wizard in vendor panel capturing required data (AC1).
- [ ] Extend backend vendor onboarding API to persist compliance artifacts securely (AC1, AC4).
- [ ] Build admin review endpoints/UI for approval lifecycle with notifications (AC2).
- [ ] Integrate Stripe Connect onboarding flow and enforce completion gating (AC3).
- [ ] Add audit logging for submissions, reviewer actions, and KYC state changes (AC4).
- [ ] Update documentation and vendor onboarding FAQ (AC1-AC4).

## Dev Notes
- Vendor panel wizard components: `vendorpanel/src/pages/onboarding/` and shared form utilities.
- Backend services likely under `backend/src/modules/vendor-management/`; ensure transactional writes.
- Sensitive documents may require storage in secure bucket (MinIO) with signed URLs.
- Notifications via email or in-app; reuse existing messaging service if available.
- Stripe Connect integration should leverage backend service to manage account status polling.

## Testing
- Component tests for wizard validation and navigation (React Testing Library).
- Backend integration tests verifying data persistence, approval transitions, and audit logging.
- Mock Stripe Connect flow in automated tests to cover success/failure cases.
- QA scenario: end-to-end onboarding culminating in admin approval and activation.
