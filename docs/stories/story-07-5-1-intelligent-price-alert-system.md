**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As an active trader, I want intelligent price alerts so that I can be notified of market opportunities and important price movements._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Customizable price threshold alerts (above/below specific prices)
- (NOT BUILT) Percentage change alerts for significant movements
- (NOT BUILT) Volume spike alerts for unusual trading activity
- (NOT BUILT) Alert delivery via email, push notification, SMS, and in-app
- (NOT BUILT) Alert grouping to prevent notification overload
- (NOT BUILT) Smart alert suggestions based on collection and watchlist
- (NOT BUILT) Alert history with outcome tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Bulk alert management for multiple cards
- (NOT BUILT) Alert templates for common monitoring scenarios
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with portfolio to show alert impact on collection value

## Implementation Notes

The price alert system would support threshold-based (card crosses $X), percentage-based (card moves more than Y%), and pattern-based (card hits 52-week high/low) triggers. Alert delivery would be configurable by priority level with high-priority alerts always delivered immediately. Smart suggestions would automatically recommend alerts for cards in the user's collection that show unusual volatility or are approaching watchlist target prices.
