## User Story

_As an investor, I want sophisticated analytics for my portfolio so that I can understand its performance and make strategic decisions._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Risk-adjusted return calculations (Sharpe ratio equivalent for card portfolios)
- (NOT BUILT) Volatility metrics showing collection stability over time
- (NOT BUILT) Drawdown analysis identifying peak-to-trough value declines
- (NOT BUILT) Rolling performance windows (30/90/180/365 day returns)
- (NOT BUILT) Sector analysis showing performance by game, set type, and rarity tier
- (NOT BUILT) Liquidity analysis estimating time-to-sell for portfolio components
- (NOT BUILT) Concentration risk indicators for over-weighted positions
- (NOT BUILT) Alpha generation tracking against passive collection strategies
- (NOT BUILT) Peer performance comparison with anonymized similar portfolios
- (NOT BUILT) Automated performance reports with actionable insights

## Implementation Notes

Advanced portfolio analytics would apply investment portfolio theory to card collections. Risk-adjusted returns would normalize performance by volatility, rewarding consistent gains over volatile spikes. Drawdown analysis would identify the worst losing periods for each card category. Liquidity analysis would estimate how long specific cards would take to sell at fair market value based on trading volume data.
