# Story 4.4: Automation Rules Engine

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** vendor,
**I want** automation rules,
**so that** routine inventory and pricing tasks execute without manual effort.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AC1: Rules builder allows conditions (inventory levels, price deltas) and actions (price update, restock request).
2. AC2: Jobs execute via background workers with execution history per rule.
3. AC3: Conflicting rule detection and throttling guardrails implemented.
4. AC4: Vendors receive notifications when automation actions run.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design rules schema (conditions, actions, schedules) and persistence model (AC1).
- [ ] Build vendor panel UI for creating, editing, enabling/disabling rules with previews (AC1).
- [ ] Implement worker processing rules, invoking applicable actions, and recording execution logs (AC2).
- [ ] Add conflict detection + throttling to prevent oscillating or duplicate actions (AC3).
- [ ] Integrate notification service to inform vendors when rules execute or fail (AC4).
- [ ] Document rule templates and guardrails for vendor success team (AC1-AC4).

## Dev Notes
- Store rule definitions in `backend/src/modules/vendor-automation` with TypeORM entities.
- Use BullMQ scheduled jobs or cron-based triggers for evaluation cadence.
- Actions may call pricing service (Epic 07) or inventory adjustmentsâ€”ensure APIs support idempotency.
- Execution history accessible via vendor panel page `vendorpanel/src/pages/automation/logs` (create).
- Provide kill switch to disable all rules globally in case of incident.

## Testing
- Unit tests for rule evaluation engine and action execution modules.
- Integration tests simulating rules with various conditions, verifying logs & notifications.
- Playwright tests: vendor creates rule, sees execution history, receives notification.
- Stress test to ensure throttling prevents runaway loops.
