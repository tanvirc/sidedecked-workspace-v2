**Epic**: [epic-10-payment-processing.md](../epics/epic-10-payment-processing.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Commerce (backend/)

## User Story

_As a payment processor, I want sophisticated fraud detection so that I can prevent fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Machine learning-based fraud scoring with real-time risk assessment
- (NOT BUILT) Behavioral analysis including device fingerprinting and user pattern recognition
- (NOT BUILT) Transaction velocity monitoring with automatic limits and cooling-off periods
- (NOT BUILT) Cross-reference with industry fraud databases and blacklists
- (NOT BUILT) Geolocation verification with VPN detection and risk assessment
- (NOT BUILT) Card testing and enumeration attack prevention with adaptive rate limiting
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with Stripe Radar and additional third-party fraud services
- (NOT BUILT) Manual review queues for borderline cases with expert fraud analyst involvement
- (NOT BUILT) Seller risk profiling based on transaction history and community reputation
- (NOT BUILT) Real-time fraud alerts with immediate transaction holds and investigation protocols

## Implementation Notes

Advanced fraud detection uses ML-based scoring with behavioral analysis, device fingerprinting, and velocity monitoring. Stripe Radar integration combined with cross-referencing against industry blacklists and geolocation verification provides layered protection. Manual review queues and seller risk profiling handle edge cases.
