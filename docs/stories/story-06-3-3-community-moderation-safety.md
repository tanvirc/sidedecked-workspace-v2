## User Story

_As a platform administrator, I want effective moderation tools so that I can maintain a safe and positive community environment._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Content reporting system with categorized violation types
- (NOT BUILT) Moderator dashboard with queue management and action tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Automated content filtering for spam, harassment, and prohibited content
- (NOT BUILT) Warning and strike system with escalating consequences
- (NOT BUILT) Temporary and permanent ban management with appeal process

## Implementation Notes

The moderation system would use a tiered approach: automated filtering as the first line, community reporting as the second, and moderator review as the final decision-maker. The moderator dashboard would prioritize the review queue by violation severity and report count. Warning and strike systems would escalate from warnings to temporary suspensions to permanent bans. All moderation actions would be logged for accountability and appeal review.
