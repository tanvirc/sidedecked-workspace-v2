**Epic**: [epic-08-search-discovery.md](../epics/epic-08-search-discovery.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Both

## User Story

_As a player exploring the platform, I want contextual discovery features so that I can naturally explore related content and make new discoveries._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) "Related cards" suggestions on card detail pages based on synergies and similarities
- (NOT BUILT) "Also viewed" cross-navigation between similar cards and listings
- (NOT BUILT) Trending cards and sets featured on homepage and browse pages
- (NOT BUILT) "New releases" discovery section for recently added cards and sets
- (NOT BUILT) Format-specific card pools for browsing within competitive contexts
- (NOT BUILT) Contextual browsing paths (e.g., clicking artist name shows all their cards)
- (NOT BUILT) "Complete the set" prompts when viewing cards from incomplete owned sets
- (NOT BUILT) Random card discovery feature for exploring the catalog serendipitously
- (NOT BUILT) Seasonal and event-based discovery highlighting relevant cards
- (NOT BUILT) Browsing history with easily accessible recently viewed cards

## Implementation Notes

Contextual discovery would create natural pathways through the catalog. Related card suggestions on card detail pages would use semantic similarity based on card text, type, and gameplay role. Trending calculation would weight recent views, searches, and marketplace activity. Contextual browsing paths through artist, set, mechanic, or block connections would allow organic catalog exploration without explicit search queries.
