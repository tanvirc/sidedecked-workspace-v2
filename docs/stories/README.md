# BMAD Story Artifacts

Story files will be generated by the Scrum Master agent using `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` once epic refinement begins. Each story lives in `docs/stories/<epic>.<story>.<slug>.md` and includes status, acceptance criteria, tasks, dev notes, testing guidance, and change log entries. No stories have been drafted yet for the greenfield reset.

## Workflow
1. Select an epic from `../epics` and run the BMAD Scrum Master agent to draft the next story.
2. Review and adjust the generated story file, ensuring acceptance criteria align with the epic.
3. Developers execute stories in order, updating status, tasks, and dev notes as work proceeds.
4. QA agents populate the QA section and gate results before marking a story "Done".

See `.bmad-core/user-guide.md` for full BMAD instructions.
