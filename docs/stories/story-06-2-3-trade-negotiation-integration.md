# Story 6.2.3: Trade Negotiation Integration

**Epic**: [epic-06-community-social.md](../epics/epic-06-community-social.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Customer Experience (customer-backend/)

## User Story

_As a collector, I want integrated trade negotiation tools within messaging so that I can efficiently negotiate and execute card trades._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Trade proposal creation within message conversations
- (NOT BUILT) Card selection interface for trade offers with real-time value calculation
- (NOT BUILT) Counteroffer system for iterative trade negotiation
- (NOT BUILT) Trade value balancing tools showing fair value comparison
- (NOT BUILT) Trade escrow system for high-value trade protection
- (NOT BUILT) Trade history tracking with outcome records
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with user collections for trade availability validation
- (NOT BUILT) Trade completion workflow with shipping coordination
- (NOT BUILT) Dispute resolution for failed or misrepresented trades
- (NOT BUILT) Trade reputation tracking influencing community trust scores

## Implementation Notes

Trade negotiation would be embedded within the direct messaging interface with a dedicated trade proposal UI. Card selection would pull from the user's collection inventory for availability validation. Real-time value calculation would use current market pricing data. The escrow system would hold both parties' cards digitally until trade confirmation. Trade history would contribute to each user's community reputation score.
