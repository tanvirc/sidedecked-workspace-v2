## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Portfolio value forecasting with multiple scenario modeling
- (NOT BUILT) Risk assessment showing collection volatility and concentration risks
- (NOT BUILT) Rebalancing recommendations for portfolio optimization
- (NOT BUILT) What-if analysis for proposed portfolio changes
- (NOT BUILT) Correlation matrix showing relationships between collection holdings

## Implementation Notes

Predictive portfolio management would apply financial portfolio analysis techniques to card collections. Scenario modeling would project collection value under different market conditions (bull/bear markets, format changes). Risk assessment would identify over-concentration in specific sets, games, or card types. The what-if analysis tool would preview the portfolio impact of buying or selling specific cards before executing trades.
