## User Story

_As a vendor, I want automated pricing tools so that I can stay competitive without constant manual price monitoring._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Competitive pricing rules based on market conditions and competitor analysis
- (NOT BUILT) Automatic repricing based on customizable rules (match lowest, beat by X%, margin protection)
- (NOT BUILT) Price floor and ceiling settings to prevent unprofitable or unrealistic pricing
- (NOT BUILT) Seasonal pricing adjustments based on historical demand patterns
- (NOT BUILT) Promotional pricing tools for sales events and inventory clearance
- (NOT BUILT) Price change notifications and approval workflows for significant changes
- (NOT BUILT) Pricing strategy templates for different types of inventory (rare cards, bulk commons, etc.)
- (NOT BUILT) ROI optimization pricing that balances profit margins with sales velocity
- (NOT BUILT) Market trend integration adjusting prices based on format changes and meta shifts
- (NOT BUILT) Pricing performance analytics showing effectiveness of different strategies

## Implementation Notes

The pricing automation dashboard would be located at `/vendor/pricing`. The visual rule builder would support drag-and-drop conditions and actions. Pre-built strategy templates would cover Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced, and Premium approaches. An approval queue would handle significant price changes with impact analysis. Emergency stop functionality would be provided for runaway pricing rules.
