# Story 8.2.2: Smart Collection Management Integration

**Epic**: [epic-08-search-discovery.md](../epics/epic-08-search-discovery.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Both

## User Story

_As a collector, I want search and discovery features integrated with my collection so that I can easily find missing cards and optimize my collection._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Collection-aware search highlighting owned, missing, and wanted cards in results
- (NOT BUILT) "Complete my collection" smart search surfacing missing cards from owned sets
- (NOT BUILT) Collection gap analysis identifying patterns in missing cards
- (NOT BUILT) Upgrade suggestions for cards with better printings available at similar prices
- (NOT BUILT) Duplicate detection alerting users to redundant collection holdings
- (NOT BUILT) Trade opportunity discovery matching collection excesses with wants
- (NOT BUILT) Set completion tracker with purchasing recommendations
- (NOT BUILT) Collection value optimization suggesting high-value acquisitions within budget
- (NOT BUILT) Historical collection growth tracking and milestone celebration
- (NOT BUILT) Collection export and import for external tracking tools

## Implementation Notes

Collection integration would overlay ownership status on all search and browse results. The collection gap analysis would identify patterns like missing all cards of a specific rarity from owned sets and suggest targeted searches. Upgrade suggestions would find better printings (foil, alternative art) of cards already in the collection at comparable prices. Trade opportunity discovery would cross-reference collection excesses with other users' want lists.
