**Epic**: [epic-08-search-discovery.md](../epics/epic-08-search-discovery.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Both

## User Story

_As a user, I want personalized recommendations so that I can discover cards, decks, and content that matches my interests and playing style._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Personalized card recommendations based on collection, deck history, and game preferences
- (NOT BUILT) Deck recommendations from community based on user's favorite formats and archetypes
- (NOT BUILT) "Users like you also collect" collaborative filtering recommendations
- (NOT BUILT) Content recommendations for forum posts, guides, and community discussions
- (NOT BUILT) Price drop alerts for cards on user's watchlist or in similar collections
- (NOT BUILT) Format rotation recommendations for affected deck cards
- (NOT BUILT) Seasonal recommendations aligned with tournament schedules
- (NOT BUILT) Diversity recommendations to introduce users to new games and formats
- (NOT BUILT) Recommendation explanation showing why each item was suggested
- (NOT BUILT) Feedback mechanism to improve recommendation quality over time

## Implementation Notes

Recommendation engine would use collaborative filtering (users with similar collections) and content-based filtering (card attributes matching user preferences). Transparency in recommendations would show the reasoning behind each suggestion. The feedback mechanism would allow users to mark recommendations as helpful, not interested, or already owned, improving future personalization.
