**Epic**: [epic-10-payment-processing.md](../epics/epic-10-payment-processing.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Commerce (backend/)

## User Story

_As a secure payment system, I want complete PCI compliance so that customer payment data is protected to the highest standards._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) PCI DSS Level 1 compliance certification with annual validation and maintenance
- (NOT BUILT) Tokenization of all payment data with secure token management
- (NOT BUILT) End-to-end encryption for all payment transactions and sensitive data
- (NOT BUILT) Secure API endpoints with TLS 1.3 encryption and certificate management
- (NOT BUILT) Regular security audits and penetration testing with remediation tracking
- (NOT BUILT) Employee access controls with multi-factor authentication and least privilege principles
- (NOT BUILT) Secure development lifecycle with security review for all payment-related code
- (NOT BUILT) Incident response plan with breach notification and remediation procedures
- (NOT BUILT) Data retention policies with automatic purging of sensitive payment information
- (NOT BUILT) Third-party vendor security assessments for all payment-related integrations

## Implementation Notes

PCI DSS Level 1 compliance requires tokenization of all payment data, end-to-end encryption, and TLS 1.3 for all API endpoints. Annual validation, regular penetration testing, employee access controls with MFA, and an incident response plan are mandatory compliance requirements. Data retention policies with automatic purging protect customer information.
