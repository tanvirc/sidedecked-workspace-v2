# Story 7.3: Vendor Pricing Guidance

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** vendor,
**I want** pricing recommendations,
**so that** I stay competitive without manual analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AC1: Vendor panel shows suggested price ranges with rationale (market average, velocity).
2. AC2: Bulk recommendation export available for CSV inventory updates.
3. AC3: Track acceptance of suggestions and impact on sales KPIs.
4. AC4: Feedback loop captures manual overrides to improve future guidance.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Develop recommendation model combining pricing analytics and sales velocity (AC1).
- [ ] Surface recommendations in vendor panel UI with explanations and apply buttons (AC1).
- [ ] Provide bulk export (CSV/JSON) for applying suggestions offline (AC2).
- [ ] Capture acceptance/decline actions and feed metrics dashboard (AC3).
- [ ] Log manual overrides and feed back into recommendation engine for tuning (AC4).
- [ ] Document usage guidelines for vendors and success team (AC1-AC4).

## Dev Notes
- Recommendation service under `customer-backend/packages/pricing/guidance`; may reuse data from analytics tables.
- Vendor panel UI: `vendorpanel/src/pages/pricing-guidance` (new) with filters and bulk actions.
- Track outcomes (sales, GMV) post-acceptance to assess guidance effectiveness.
- Feedback loop should store reasons for overrides if vendor provides notes.
- Ensure suggestions respect inventory levels and vendor-specific pricing rules.

## Testing
- Unit tests for recommendation calculations and thresholds.
- Integration tests verifying UI actions update backend state and metrics.
- Playwright scenario: vendor reviews recommendations, accepts subset, exports remainder.
- Post-deployment analytics validation comparing acceptance vs sales improvement.
