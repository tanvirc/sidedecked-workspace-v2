## User Story

_As a collector, I want detailed portfolio tracking so that I can monitor my collection's value and performance over time._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Real-time collection valuation using current market prices
- (NOT BUILT) Historical value tracking with daily snapshots and trend visualization
- (NOT BUILT) Gain/loss tracking with cost basis management
- (NOT BUILT) Collection segmentation by game, set, rarity, and card type
- (NOT BUILT) Performance attribution showing which cards drive value changes
- (NOT BUILT) Acquisition cost tracking with purchase date and price history
- (NOT BUILT) Print and condition variant tracking within collection
- (NOT BUILT) Collection comparison against market indices and benchmarks
- (NOT BUILT) Export functionality for tax and insurance reporting
- (NOT BUILT) Mobile-optimized portfolio dashboard with key metrics

## Implementation Notes

Portfolio tracking would integrate with the inventory management system for collection data and the pricing intelligence system for valuations. Daily snapshots would enable historical performance charting. Cost basis tracking would support FIFO and specific identification methods. Collection segmentation would allow filtering by game, set, rarity, and custom tags. Export formats would support CSV and PDF for insurance documentation and tax reporting.
