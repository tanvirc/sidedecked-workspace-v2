# Story 8.3.1: Visual Card Recognition & Search

**Epic**: [epic-08-search-discovery.md](../epics/epic-08-search-discovery.md)
**Status**: not_started
**Domain**: Both

## User Story

_As a user, I want to search for cards using images so that I can identify unknown cards and find similar artwork or designs._

## Acceptance Criteria

- (NOT BUILT) Upload card photo to identify the card name, set, and printing
- (NOT BUILT) Mobile camera integration for real-time card scanning and recognition
- (NOT BUILT) Recognition confidence score with alternative matches for unclear photos
- (NOT BUILT) Artwork similarity search for finding cards with similar visual themes
- (NOT BUILT) Artist search for browsing cards by specific card artists
- (NOT BUILT) Batch card recognition for processing multiple cards from a single photo
- (NOT BUILT) Recognition accuracy improvement through user correction feedback
- (NOT BUILT) Integration with listing creation for quick card identification
- (NOT BUILT) Offline recognition capability using cached card image data
- (NOT BUILT) QR code and barcode scanning support for packaged cards

## Implementation Notes

Visual recognition would use image matching against the card catalog's image database. Mobile camera integration would provide a live viewfinder with real-time recognition feedback. Confidence scoring would rank potential matches by similarity percentage. Artwork similarity search would use image embedding vectors to find visually related cards across the catalog. User corrections when recognition errors occur would feed back into accuracy improvement.
