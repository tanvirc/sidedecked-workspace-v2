# Epic 08: Search & Discovery System

> **Status**: Not Started · **Bounded Context**: Search Experience · **Primary Repos**: `storefront`, `customer-backend`

## Epic Goal
Deliver high-performance search, filtering, and recommendation capabilities that help users discover cards, decks, vendors, and content quickly.

## Dependencies
- Catalog index from Epic 03.
- Pricing and availability data (Epics 02, 07, 09).
- Personalization signals from community activity (Epic 06).

## Assumptions
- Algolia used for primary search index with nightly full reindex and incremental updates.
- Recommendation models start rule-based, evolve to ML in future phases.
- Search analytics captured for relevance tuning.

## Stories

### Story 8.1: Catalog Search API & Indexing
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a shopper, I want fast search results so that I can find cards quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Index includes card name, set, rarity, condition, price, vendor availability.
2. Search latency under 200ms P95 with pagination and highlighting.
3. Filters for game, price range, language, foil, vendor type.
4. Synonym and typo tolerance configured per game with analytics feedback loop.

### Story 8.2: Discovery & Recommendations
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a user, I want personalized recommendations so that I discover relevant cards and decks.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Recommendation modules on home page, card pages, and deck pages.
2. Signals include purchase history, deck composition, viewing behavior.
3. Cold-start fallback using trending cards and staff picks.
4. Ability to dismiss recommendations which feeds suppression list.

### Story 8.3: Advanced Filtering UI
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a collector, I want advanced filters so that I can narrow results precisely.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Faceted UI with multi-select controls, range sliders, and token inputs.
2. Filters persist in URL/query params for shareability.
3. Filter combinations update results without full page reload (infinite scroll with virtualization).
4. Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, aria labels) verified.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Index drift**: Establish versioning and monitoring for stale records.
- **Personalization privacy**: Respect user opt-outs and anonymize analytics.

## QA Strategy
- Search relevance tests with curated query sets.
- UI regression tests for facet combinations and pagination.
- Performance monitoring using synthetic tests.
