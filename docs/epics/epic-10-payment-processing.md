# Epic 10: Payment Processing System

> **Status**: Not Started · **Bounded Context**: Payments · **Primary Repos**: `backend`, `storefront`

## Epic Goal
Implement secure, compliant payment flows for multi-vendor checkout, refunds, payouts, and financial reconciliation using Stripe Connect.

## Dependencies
- Checkout flows (Epic 02).
- Vendor onboarding with Stripe accounts (Epic 04).
- Accounting exports requirements (to be defined with finance stakeholders).

## Assumptions
- Stripe Connect Custom accounts per vendor with managed onboarding.
- Payment intents created per vendor but confirmed in single customer session.
- Webhooks processed via dedicated queue worker with signature verification.

## Stories

### Story 10.1: Payment Intent Orchestration
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a customer, I want a seamless payment experience so that checkout feels trustworthy.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Backend creates payment intents per vendor with application fees and captures on confirmation.
2. Storefront handles 3DS/SCA flows via Stripe Elements with clear error handling.
3. Partial failures roll back captured charges and restore cart state.
4. Successful payment produces order and receipt records linked to Stripe ids.

### Story 10.2: Refunds & Disputes
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As support staff, I want to manage refunds and disputes so that customers are protected.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Admin tools initiate full or partial refunds with reason codes and audit trail.
2. Stripe dispute webhook updates order status and notifies support queue.
3. Refund statuses synced back to storefront and vendor analytics.
4. Policies enforced (time limits, restocking fees) with validations.

### Story 10.3: Vendor Payouts & Reconciliation
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As finance, I want accurate payouts so that vendors are paid correctly and on time.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Scheduled payouts triggered per vendor with configurable frequency.
2. Fees, taxes, and platform commissions calculated and stored per order line.
3. Exportable reconciliation reports (CSV, JSON) for accounting systems.
4. Alerts for failed payouts or pending verification requirements.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Compliance**: Follow PCI scope reduction best practices; never store raw card data.
- **Webhook reliability**: Implement idempotency and retry with exponential backoff.

## QA Strategy
- Integration tests using Stripe test keys covering success, failure, dispute flows.
- Contract tests validating webhook payload processing.
- Load tests simulating concurrent checkout spikes.
