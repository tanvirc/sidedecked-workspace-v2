# Epic 07: Pricing Intelligence System

> **Status**: Not Started · **Bounded Context**: Pricing Analytics · **Primary Repos**: `customer-backend`, `storefront`

## Epic Goal
Provide actionable pricing analytics, alerts, and dashboards that help customers and vendors make informed decisions based on market data.

## Dependencies
- Pricing feed aggregation from Epic 03.
- Marketplace orders and vendor sales metrics (Epic 02 & 04).
- Notification delivery (Epic 06).

## Assumptions
- Analytics warehouse tables refreshed hourly with incremental updates.
- Dashboards served via API consumed by storefront UI components.
- Alert thresholds configurable per user and stored with metadata.

## Stories

### Story 7.1: Pricing Dashboard
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a customer, I want a pricing dashboard so that I can track market trends.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Charts display historical median, low, and high prices per card and condition.
2. Filters for game, set, foil, language, vendor type.
3. Data points include confidence intervals and change indicators (24h, 7d, 30d).
4. Dashboard responsive across desktop/mobile with caching of chart data.

### Story 7.2: Price Alerting Engine
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a collector, I want alerts when prices move so that I can buy or sell timely.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Users define alert rules (price drops %, absolute value, availability changes).
2. Engine evaluates rules on new pricing events and queues notifications.
3. Deduplicate alerts per user within configurable quiet periods.
4. Notification payload links to relevant product pages and includes summary.

### Story 7.3: Vendor Pricing Guidance
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a vendor, I want pricing recommendations so that I stay competitive.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Vendor panel shows suggested price ranges with rationale (market average, velocity).
2. Bulk recommendation export for CSV inventory updates.
3. Track acceptance of suggestions and impact on sales KPIs.
4. Feedback loop captures manual overrides to improve future guidance.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Data freshness**: Monitor ETL latency and expose status to UI.
- **Alert fatigue**: Provide digest mode and configurable thresholds.

## QA Strategy
- Statistical validation tests for aggregation logic.
- Integration tests for alert triggers with mocked events.
- Visual regression of dashboard components.
