# Epic 09: Inventory Management System

> **Status**: Not Started · **Bounded Context**: Inventory · **Primary Repos**: `backend`, `customer-backend`

## Epic Goal
Ensure accurate, real-time inventory synchronization across vendors and storefront, covering stock ingestion, reservations, adjustments, and auditability.

## Dependencies
- Vendor CSV/API ingest (Epic 04).
- Order fulfillment events (Epic 02).
- Catalog identifiers and mapping (Epic 03).

## Assumptions
- Inventory stored per vendor product with condition, language, quantity, price.
- Reservations created during checkout and released on timeout/cancel.
- Audit log retained for at least 1 year per compliance.

## Stories

### Story 9.1: Inventory Ingestion Service
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a vendor integrator, I want ingestion endpoints so that stock stays synced.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. API accepts incremental updates (create, update, delete) with idempotent behavior.
2. Validation ensures catalog mapping and rejects invalid payloads with actionable errors.
3. Processing pipeline queues jobs and surfaces status to vendor panel.
4. Ingestion metrics (latency, rows processed) exposed for monitoring.

### Story 9.2: Reservation & Allocation
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As the commerce engine, I want to reserve inventory during checkout so that oversells are prevented.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Cart checkout creates reservations with expiration; timers run via queue workers.
2. Successful payment converts reservation to fulfillment entry; failure releases stock.
3. Inventory locks respected across distributed instances (transactional integrity).
4. Edge cases handled (partial fulfillment, vendor cancellations).

### Story 9.3: Inventory Dashboard & Alerts
**Status**: Not Started  
**Story**: As a vendor, I want visibility into stock health so that I can take action quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Dashboard shows real-time stock levels, reserved quantities, and aging inventory.
2. Threshold-based alerts for low stock or stale product auto-trigger notifications.
3. Manual adjustment tools with reason codes and approval workflow.
4. Exports available for reconciliation with external systems.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Race conditions**: Use database locks or advisory locks for high-value products.
- **Vendor API variability**: Provide SDKs and validation schema docs.

## QA Strategy
- Unit tests for reservation logic and state transitions.
- Integration tests simulating concurrent checkout flows.
- Reconciliation tests comparing vendor feed to internal counts.
