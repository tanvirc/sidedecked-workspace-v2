# BMAD QA Gates

Quality gates, regression matrices, and test plans will be authored per epic under this directory. Follow the `qa-gate-tmpl` provided in `.bmad-core/templates` to create artifacts such as `docs/qa/epic-01-authentication.md`.

- Include test coverage expectations per story.
- Track automated vs manual coverage along with outstanding risks.
- Reference repository-specific testing commands (`npm run test`, `npm run test:coverage`, etc.).

Initial drafts are pending and should be created as soon as stories are queued for development.
