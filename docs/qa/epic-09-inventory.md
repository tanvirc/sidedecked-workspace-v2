# QA Gate – Epic 09 Inventory Management

- **Gate Status**: Pending
- **QA Owner**: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Entry Criteria
- Story 09.1 ingestion service available in staging with sample vendor credentials.
- Reservation engine mock ready for checkout integration tests.

## Exit Criteria
- Reconciliation tests comparing vendor feed vs internal counts with automated diffs.
- Concurrency tests covering simultaneous reservations and releases.
- Alerting configured for ingestion failures and inventory drift.

## Coverage Strategy
- Unit: ingestion validators, reservation state transitions.
- Integration: bulk upload processing, queue workers, vendor panel status updates.
- E2E: Vendor uploads file, verifies status, storefront reflects updated inventory.

## Outstanding Risks
- High-volume vendors may require rate limiting—needs modelling.
- Audit log retention policies to be confirmed with compliance.

## Artifacts & Evidence
- Reconciliation scripts stored in `backend/scripts/reconciliation/`.
- Test datasets maintained under `vendorpanel/tests/fixtures/inventory/`.
