# QA Gate – Epic 01 Authentication & User Management

- **Gate Status**: Pending
- **QA Owner**: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Entry Criteria
- Story 01.1 implemented with unit/integration coverage ≥80%.
- Story 01.2 drafted and in progress to ensure onboarding flow continuity.
- OAuth providers configured in staging with sandbox credentials.

## Exit Criteria
- Automated suite exercising registration, login, and email verification flows (Playwright + Jest).
- Security validation: rate limiting, PKCE/state validation, MFA smoke test results recorded.
- Observability hooks emit login success/failure metrics with alert thresholds defined.

## Coverage Strategy
- Unit tests: backend auth services, token rotation.
- Integration tests: OAuth happy/error paths, email verification.
- E2E: Multi-provider registration and login, session revocation.

## Outstanding Risks
- Email deliverability not yet validated; coordinate with infrastructure.
- MFA story pending—flag as follow-up before release.

## Artifacts & Evidence
- Test reports stored under `backend/reports/auth/` (to be generated).
- Security review checklist to be appended prior to gate sign-off.
