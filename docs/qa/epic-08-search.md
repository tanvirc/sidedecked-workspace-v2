# QA Gate – Epic 08 Search & Discovery

- **Gate Status**: Pending
- **QA Owner**: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Entry Criteria
- Story 08.1 search index populated with staging dataset.
- Search analytics dashboard configured (Algolia or internal).

## Exit Criteria
- Relevance evaluation across curated query set with acceptance thresholds.
- Response latency monitored <200ms P95 under synthetic load.
- Accessibility audit for filter UI and infinite scroll behaviour.

## Coverage Strategy
- Unit: filter serialization, query builders, analytics instrumentation.
- Integration: index synchronization pipeline, search API responses.
- E2E: execute top user journeys (search, filter, view details) on desktop and mobile.

## Outstanding Risks
- Index drift after partial updates—monitor incremental syncing process.
- Personalization privacy review pending for recommendation subsystem.

## Artifacts & Evidence
- Relevance test harness located at `storefront/tests/relevance/`.
- Latency monitoring dashboards linked in `docs/epics/epic-08-search-discovery.md`.
