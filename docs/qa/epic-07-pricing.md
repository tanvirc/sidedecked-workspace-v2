# QA Gate – Epic 07 Pricing Intelligence

- **Gate Status**: Pending
- **QA Owner**: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Entry Criteria
- Story 07.1 dashboard available with sample data.
- Alerting engine prototype prepared for integration tests.

## Exit Criteria
- Statistical validation confirming aggregation accuracy within tolerances.
- Alert deduplication scenarios tested (quiet periods, thresholds).
- Vendor pricing recommendations validated against historical sales data.

## Coverage Strategy
- Unit: aggregation math, confidence interval calculations.
- Integration: alert triggering pipelines with mocked events.
- E2E: Configure alert, trigger data change, verify notification and dashboard update.

## Outstanding Risks
- Data freshness SLA reliant on ETL cadence—monitor dependency on Epic 03.
- High-volume alert bursts could strain notification service; load test required.

## Artifacts & Evidence
- Statistical validation notebooks stored in `analytics/notebooks/pricing/`.
- Alert engine logs archived in `customer-backend/logs/pricing-alerts/`.
