## Business Rules

### Card Data Rules

- Each card must belong to exactly one game and one set
- Card names within a set must be unique (case-insensitive)
- SKUs must be globally unique across all games and sets
- Mana costs must follow game-specific formatting rules
- Power/toughness values must be valid for card types that support them
- Rarity must be valid for the specific game and set

### Image Management Rules

- All images must comply with copyright and fair use guidelines
- Custom uploaded images limited to 10MB and specific formats

### Search and Discovery Rules

- Search results limited to 100 items per page for performance
