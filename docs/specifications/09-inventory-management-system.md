# Inventory Management System (Legacy Specification)

Inventory requirements are tracked via BMAD epics and stories.

- Current epic: `docs/epics/epic-09-inventory-management.md`
- Source PRD: `docs/prd.md`
- Architecture baseline: `docs/architecture.md`

Legacy acceptance statuses have been reset; the BMAD workflow owns implementation tracking.
