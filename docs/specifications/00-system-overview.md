## System Integration Map

### Data Flow
```
Authentication System → All Systems (user identity)
TCG Catalog → Commerce (product data)
TCG Catalog → Deck Builder (card data)
TCG Catalog → Search (indexed content)
Commerce → Payment (transaction processing)
Commerce → Inventory (stock management)
Vendor Management → Inventory (vendor operations)
Pricing Intelligence → Commerce (market data)
Community → Deck Builder (social features)
Search → All Systems (discovery)
```

### Key Integration Points
- **Authentication** provides user identity to all systems
- **TCG Catalog** serves as the foundation data source
- **Commerce & Inventory** work in tight coordination
- **Search** indexes data from all content systems
- **Payment** processes all financial transactions
- **Community** adds social layer to all features

## Technology Stack

## Implementation Approach

### Phase-Based Development
Each system can be developed independently while maintaining integration points:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Authentication and TCG Catalog
2. **Commerce Phase**: Marketplace and Payment systems  
3. **Experience Phase**: Search, Community, and Deck Builder
4. **Intelligence Phase**: Pricing and advanced features
5. **Operations Phase**: Vendor Management and Inventory

### Integration Strategy
- API-first design for all systems
- Event-driven architecture for real-time features
- Shared data models for cross-system consistency
- Comprehensive integration testing

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Read the specific system specification you're implementing
2. Review the Technology Stack and Database Schema sections
3. Follow the User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
4. Implement API Endpoints as specified
5. Ensure all Business Rules are enforced
6. Add comprehensive testing per Testing Requirements

### For Business Analysts
1. Each specification includes Executive Summary for context
2. User Stories are written in plain English with business value
3. Business Rules section explains operational constraints
4. Integration Requirements show how systems work together

### For Product Owners
1. User Stories provide complete feature definitions
2. Acceptance Criteria define done conditions
3. Performance Requirements set quality expectations
4. Each system can be prioritized and delivered independently

## Documentation Standards

Each specification follows a consistent structure:
- **Executive Summary**: Business context and purpose
- **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed feature requirements
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation details
- **Business Rules**: Operational constraints
- **Integration Requirements**: System interconnections
