# Authentication & User Management System

## Executive Summary

The Authentication & User Management System provides secure user registration, authentication, and profile management for all SideDecked users. It supports OAuth2 social login with Google and GitHub, implements JWT-based session management, and provides role-based access control for customers, individual sellers, and administrators. This system serves as the foundation for all user interactions across the platform.
