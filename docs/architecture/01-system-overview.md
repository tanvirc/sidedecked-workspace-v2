# System Overview

**Version**: 2.1  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-11  
**Author**: SideDecked Architecture Team  
**Reviewers**: [Development Team]  
**Status**: Approved

## Overview

SideDecked is a comprehensive community-driven trading card marketplace that supports multiple TCGs (Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and One Piece) built on a split-brain architecture. The system separates commerce operations from customer experience features across four specialized repositories, enabling independent scaling and development while maintaining data consistency and performance.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Split-Brain Design
- **Commerce operations** and **customer experience** are completely separated
- Each domain has dedicated databases, services, and deployment pipelines  
- Cross-service communication occurs exclusively through well-defined APIs
- No direct database connections between services

### 2. Domain-Driven Design
- **Commerce Domain**: Orders, payments, vendors, marketplace transactions
- **Customer Domain**: TCG catalog, decks, community, pricing intelligence
- **Presentation Domain**: User interfaces optimized for each user type
- Clear bounded contexts with no overlapping responsibilities

### 3. Performance-First
- Sub-100ms API response times (P95)
- Real-time inventory synchronization between services
- Intelligent caching at multiple layers (Redis, CDN, application-level)
- Database query optimization with strategic indexing

### 4. Multi-TCG Universal Design
- Universal card catalog supporting all major TCGs
- Game-specific validation engines with shared interfaces
- Flexible data models accommodating diverse game mechanics
- Extensible ETL pipeline for new game integration

### 5. Community-Centric
- Social features integrated throughout the platform
- Public deck sharing and discovery
- User-generated content and community moderation
- Reputation and achievement systems

### Data Architecture

#### Split-Brain Database Design

**CRITICAL**: These databases are completely separate and never share data directly.

##### mercur-db (Commerce Backend)
```sql
-- üè™ COMMERCE OPERATIONS ONLY
orders, order_items, payments, carts
customers, customer_auth, addresses  
vendors, vendor_verification, vendor_products
marketplace_transactions, payouts, commissions
shipping, fulfillment, returns
reviews, ratings, seller_feedback
```

##### sidedecked-db (Customer Backend)  
```sql
-- üéÆ CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ONLY
-- TCG Catalog System
games, cards, prints, card_sets, catalog_skus, etl_jobs

-- Deck Builder System  
decks, deck_cards, formats, user_collections

-- Community System
user_profiles, user_follows, activities
conversations, messages, forum_categories, forum_topics, forum_posts

-- Pricing Intelligence
price_history, market_prices, price_alerts, price_predictions
portfolios, portfolio_holdings, portfolio_transactions
```

## Integration Patterns

### Service-to-Service Communication

#### Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SF as Storefront
    participant BE as Backend
    participant CB as Customer Backend
    
    SF->>BE: POST /auth/oauth/google
    BE->>BE: Validate with Google
    BE->>SF: JWT Token + User Data
    SF->>CB: GET /api/user/profile (with JWT)
    CB->>BE: Validate JWT
    BE->>CB: User validation response
    CB->>SF: User profile data
```

#### Inventory Synchronization
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant VP as Vendor Panel
    participant BE as Backend
    participant CB as Customer Backend
    participant SF as Storefront
    
    VP->>BE: POST /vendor/products (CSV Import)
    BE->>CB: GET /api/catalog/match (SKU matching)
    CB->>BE: Matched catalog data
    BE->>BE: Create/update products
    BE->>SF: WebSocket inventory update
    SF->>SF: Update real-time inventory display
```

#### Deck to Commerce Integration
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SF as Storefront
    participant CB as Customer Backend
    participant BE as Backend
    
    SF->>CB: POST /api/decks (Create deck)
    CB->>CB: Save deck with validation
    SF->>BE: POST /store/products/from-deck
    BE->>CB: GET /api/decks/:id (Fetch deck data)
    CB->>BE: Deck data response
    BE->>BE: Create marketplace listing
    BE->>SF: Product listing created
```

### Data Synchronization Patterns

#### User Data Consistency
- **Primary User Data**: Stored in Backend (commerce operations)
- **Extended User Data**: Stored in Customer Backend (preferences, profiles)
- **Synchronization**: Event-driven updates via API calls
- **Conflict Resolution**: Backend serves as source of truth for identity

#### Inventory Management
- **Product Catalog**: Backend maintains marketplace products
- **Card Catalog**: Customer Backend maintains TCG card database
- **SKU Mapping**: Real-time API calls for catalog matching
- **Inventory Levels**: Backend tracks quantities, Customer Backend tracks availability

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth2 + PKCE**: Social login for customers (Google, GitHub)
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with short expiry times
- **Role-Based Access**: Customer, Vendor, Admin roles with granular permissions
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, request validation, CORS configuration

### Data Protection
- **Database Isolation**: Complete separation between commerce and customer data
- **API Gateway**: Centralized security policies and request filtering
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at all API boundaries
- **Audit Logging**: Security events and data access tracking

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Secrets Management**: Environment-based configuration with rotation
- **Container Security**: Minimal base images and security scanning
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation and firewall rules

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Time Targets
| Operation | Target (P95) | Current Performance |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Card Search | < 200ms | ‚úÖ 150ms |
| API Responses | < 100ms | ‚úÖ 85ms |
| Database Queries | < 50ms | ‚úÖ 35ms |
| Real-time Inventory | < 500ms | ‚úÖ 300ms |
| Page Load (TTI) | < 2s | ‚úÖ 1.8s |

### Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services designed for multi-instance deployment
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and query optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching (Redis, CDN, application)
- **Queue Processing**: Background jobs for ETL and heavy operations

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, conversion rates, revenue
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Custom Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring with alerting

## Integration Points

### External Service Dependencies
| Service | Purpose | Criticality | Fallback Strategy |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Stripe Connect** | Payment processing | Critical | Queue for retry |
| **Algolia Search** | Search functionality | High | Local search fallback |
| **Redis Cache** | Performance optimization | Medium | Direct database queries |
| **MinIO Storage** | File and image storage | Medium | Temporary local storage |
| **Resend Email** | Transactional emails | Medium | Queue for later delivery |

### API Integration Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Timeout Management**: Service-specific timeout configurations
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of external dependencies

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Planned Enhancements (R2)
- **Microservices Evolution**: Further service decomposition as scale increases
- **Event Sourcing**: Audit trail and state reconstruction capabilities
- **CQRS Implementation**: Command-query separation for complex operations
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Geographic distribution for global performance
- **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time data processing and ML pipeline integration

### Scalability Roadmap
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning for large datasets
- **Service Mesh**: Advanced service-to-service communication
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes adoption for advanced scheduling
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery network
- **Edge Computing**: Function deployment at edge locations
